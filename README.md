# Big Notice
## some code i got some help for chatgpt but mostly i made the code, chatgpt mostly just helps me with my bad code a bit.

# Quick how to install
## There will eventually be a folder for compiled versions or an installer for it in the packages.
## The zip version you have to manually get from the source code under "Still need to add a folder for builds.

# For Testers (ikaw Eumilene at yun iba kung meron)
## To install go ahead and click the "Packages" and click "INSTALLERNAME.exe will replace" and once done installing it you can just run it.
## Now it may ask where to install simply make a folder on youre desktop or anywhere of youre choice then name it something like FireFightInstall
## then just copy its file path and paste it in to the installer. Also i may send videos of progress and additions if you dont want to install it :) .
